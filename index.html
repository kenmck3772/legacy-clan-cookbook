    <!-- Chosen Palette: Highland Mist -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now structured around the user's personal legacy. It opens with 'The Flamekeeper's Story,' establishing the dual Armstrong-McKenzie heritage. A new, prominent 'Find Your Clan' section with a search bar is added near the top, making personal discovery a primary user action. The main navigation is expanded to include this new feature. The structure flows from personal identity (Find Your Clan) to broader history (The Clans, The Map) and practical application (The Cookbook, Bonus Chapters), creating a comprehensive and engaging user journey. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Report Info: User's Dual Heritage (Armstrong/McKenzie) -> Goal: Frame the entire project with a personal narrative -> Viz/Method: A prominent introductory text section with stylized typography. -> Justification: Immediately establishes the unique, personal context of the project, making it more compelling than a generic cookbook. 2. Report Info: Searchable Clan/Surname Database -> Goal: Allow users to find their clan affiliation -> Viz/Method: A JavaScript-powered search bar that dynamically filters a large data object of surnames and septs. -> Interaction: As the user types their surname, the application instantly displays the associated clan's crest, motto, and a summary. -> Justification: This is a highly engaging, interactive feature that directly addresses the user's need for personal connection and makes the historical content immediately relevant. 3. Report Info: Recipes with Substitutions & Dual Measurements -> Goal: Make historical recipes practical for a modern, global audience -> Viz/Method: A structured HTML table within the recipe modal. -> Interaction: The modal now displays a clear, easy-to-read table for ingredients, showing Traditional, Substitute, UK Metric, and US Imperial values. -> Justification: This is a critical usability improvement that directly addresses the source material's requirement for American-friendly adaptations and makes the recipes genuinely cookable for a wider audience. -->

                    "My name is Kenneth Scott McKenzie. It’s a name that carries two Highland legacies. My mother is a McKenzie, her father Kenneth Candlish McKenzie, a name that whispers of the Isle of Lewis and the great Seaforth chiefs. My father is an Armstrong, a name that rings with the fierce, defiant spirit of the Border Reivers. I am the first of my generation to carry the McKenzie name forward, a conscious choice to tend the flame of a story that blends the visionary fire of the Mackenzies with the warrior heart of the Armstrongs. This project is not just a cookbook. It’s for the forgotten families, the blended bloodlines, and the quiet names that held the Highlands together. This is my legacy—and theirs."

                MacKenzie: { name: "MacKenzie", title: "The Stag's Antler", motto: "Luceo non uro — I shine, not burn", history: "A powerful Highland clan of Gaelic origin who held vast territories in Ross-shire. Their heartland was Kintail, dominated by the iconic Eilean Donan Castle. Known for their fierce loyalty and significant roles in the Jacobite risings, their motto reflects a desire to lead through enlightenment rather than destruction.", larder: "A blend of Highland and coastal bounty. Their inland territories were rich in **venison** and provided grazing for **cattle**. Their extensive coastline along the western seaboard offered plentiful **whitefish like cod and haddock**. They relied on **oats and barley**, and their dairy production led to fresh cheeses like **crowdie**." },
                Armstrong: { name: "Armstrong", title: "The Border Reivers", motto: "Invictus Maneo — I Remain Unvanquished", history: "One of the most feared and powerful of the Border Reiver clans, the Armstrongs dominated the Debatable Lands between Scotland and England. They were not Highlanders but Lowlanders, renowned for their skill as horsemen and their fierce, lawless independence. Their history is one of raids, feuds, and a defiant spirit against both Scottish and English crowns.", larder: "The Armstrong larder was based on what could be farmed, foraged, or 'reived' (stolen) in a raid. **Beef and mutton** from driven cattle and sheep were central. Hardy crops like **barley and root vegetables** were grown. Their food was practical and portable, designed for riders on the move. **Smoked and salted meats** were essential for preservation." },
                MacGregor: { name: "MacGregor", title: "The Outlaw Clan", motto: "'S Rioghal Mo Dhream — My Blood is Royal", history: "Few clans stir the soul like the MacGregors. Claiming royal descent, they were stripped of their name and lands in 1603, making it a capital crime to be a MacGregor. For over 170 years, they lived as outlaws, masters of survival and guerrilla warfare. The legendary Rob Roy MacGregor is their most famous son. Their story is one of persecution, resilience, and unbreakable pride.", larder: "The MacGregor diet was one of survival, mobility, and making do with what nature—or their neighbours—provided. **Venison, rabbit, and wild goat** were hunted. **Oats, kale, and foraged nettles** were staples. Their cooking was done over hidden firepits, and their meals were shared communally among bands of kin on the run." },
                Campbell: { name: "Campbell", title: "The Powerbrokers of Argyll", motto: "Ne Obliviscaris — Forget Not", history: "The story of Clan Campbell is one of ambition, political acumen, and unparalleled success. From their heartland in Argyll, they rose to become one of the largest, wealthiest, and most powerful clans, their influence stretching from the Highlands to the royal court. Their rise was fueled by unwavering support for King Robert the Bruce and a close alliance with the Stewart dynasty. This loyalty was rewarded with extensive grants of land, often at the expense of their rivals. Their power in the west was cemented after 1493, when they became the chief beneficiaries of the Crown's suppression of the MacDonalds' Lordship of the Isles. While their seat is Inveraray Castle on Loch Fyne, their holdings were vast and diverse, giving them access to a wide range of resources.", larder: "The Campbell diet was a testament to their status as landed gentry. Unlike clans confined to the rugged Highlands, they enjoyed agricultural abundance. With extensive pastureland, **beef and mutton** were central. Their Highland estates provided **venison and grouse**. Crucially, their Lowland holdings gave them access to a greater variety of **farmed produce** and their wealth ensured a supply of **imported goods** like spices and wine. They were culinary code-switchers, comfortable with both Highland tradition and Lowland fashion." },
                MacDonald: { name: "MacDonald", title: "Lords of the Isles", motto: "Per Mare Per Terras — By Sea and by Land", history: "To speak of Clan MacDonald is to speak of a dynasty that once ruled a maritime empire. Descended from the great 12th-century warrior Somerled, they ruled the Hebrides as semi-independent Lords of the Isles. Their power, culture, and diet were all shaped by the sea, blending Gaelic and Norse traditions. Their political center was the island of Islay, where the Council of the Isles met at Finlaggan. Though the Lordship was forfeited in 1493, the clan remained a dominant force in the west for centuries, their power built on mastery of the sea.", larder: "Fish and shellfish were the cornerstones of the MacDonald diet. The Hebridean waters teemed with **herring, cod, and salmon**, while the shores provided endless **lobsters, crabs, and mussels**. A mastery of Norse preservation techniques like smoking and salting was essential. The diet was supplemented by hardy crops of **oats and barley** and foraged coastal plants and **seaweeds** like dulse. Theirs was a larder drawn from the ocean's depths." },
                Fraser: { name: "Fraser", title: "Guardians of the Highland Heart", motto: "Je Suis Prest — I Am Ready", history: "Despite their deep Highland identity, the Frasers' story begins in France. Of Norman origin, they moved north from the Lowlands to establish their power base around the Beauly Firth near Inverness. They became quintessential Highland warriors, famous for their martial prowess. Romantic folklore connects their name to the French word for strawberry, *fraise*, a story immortalized in their crest. Their territory was a strategic and resource-rich location, encompassing excellent arable land, some of Scotland's best salmon rivers, and vast tracts of forest for hunting.", larder: "The Fraser diet represents a perfect microcosm of the traditional Highland larder. The rivers provided prized **Atlantic salmon**, while their extensive territories offered excellent hunting for **venison**. Good grazing land supplied **mutton and beef**. Like all clans, they relied on **oats and barley**. Their unique folklore connection to the strawberry highlights the importance of foraged **wild berries**, used in both sweet and savory dishes, blending their sophisticated origins with the wild bounty of their home." },
                MacLeod: { name: "MacLeod", title: "The Bulls of Skye", motto: "Hold Fast", history: "One of the most famous of all the Highland clans, the MacLeods have held their ancestral seat at Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye for over 800 years, making it the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Scotland. Of Norse-Gaelic descent, they are divided into two main branches: the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis. Fiercely loyal and renowned for their strong cultural traditions, including a famous piping school, their history is deeply intertwined with the rugged, dramatic landscape of Skye.", larder: "Like their MacDonald rivals, the MacLeod larder was dominated by the sea. **Fish and shellfish** were staples. However, their large landholdings on Skye also supported significant flocks of **sheep**, making mutton a key part of their diet. The moors provided **game**, and the coastline offered **seabirds and their eggs**. Their famous 'Fairy Flag' is a testament to their deep connection to the folklore and magic of their island home." },
                Grant: { name: "Grant", title: "The Rock of Strathspey", motto: "Stand Fast", history: "The Grants are a powerful clan from Strathspey, the heart of Scotland's whisky country. Of Norman origin, they settled in the Highlands in the 13th century and became staunch supporters of the Scottish Crown. Their territory, centered around the River Spey, was a strategic crossroads, rich in timber from the ancient Caledonian Forest and fertile land along the riverbanks. Their motto, 'Stand Fast,' reflects their resilience and enduring presence in the region.", larder: "The Grant larder was defined by the river and the forest. The River Spey provided an abundance of **Atlantic salmon**, which was a source of both food and wealth. The vast forests of Strathspey were prime hunting grounds for **venison and grouse**. The fertile straths were ideal for growing **barley**, a crop that would become the foundation of the region's world-famous whisky industry. Their diet was one of river-fed, forest-roaming abundance." },
                Murray: { name: "Murray", title: "The Dukes of Atholl", motto: "Furth Fortune and Fill the Fetters", history: "Clan Murray is one of Scotland's most powerful and noble families, with roots in the Flemish aristocracy. They settled in the Moray area in the 12th century and, through strategic marriages and royal service, acquired vast estates, most notably the Dukedom of Atholl in Perthshire. Their seat at Blair Castle commands the entrance to the Highlands. The Duke of Atholl holds the unique right to maintain a private army, the Atholl Highlanders. Their motto reflects their ambition and power.", larder: "The Murray larder was one of aristocratic plenty.
